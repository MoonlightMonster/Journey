### 1.1 About Me and Indie Games (1)
As a kid growing up in a town, I had an inexplicable obsession with gaming. When I was in the sixth grade of elementary school, I used my old vivo phone, which my mom didn't use, to hide in the cabinet and hide under the covers to play Pokémon. Why should I hide? Because my family has very strict control over electronic products, I am usually only allowed to play with electronic products for an hour. In my childhood, I paid a lot of attention to the content of games, and I always wanted to experience them more immersively. Later, because of this incident, they broke my phone and told me to study hard. After that, although my thoughts about games did not stop, due to the impact of my studies and the control of my family (mostly), I did not get too much exposure to games. Later, I was admitted to a relatively good university and chose to study computer science. In college, my desire for gaming was completely ignited, which was not a good thing, because I spent almost all of my time playing games, which led to a rather bad situation in my major classes. In the first semester of my sophomore year, I missed six classes and received a withdrawal warning; In the second semester of my sophomore year, I still hung up four courses and successfully retained my student status at the bottom red line. But then, if I wanted to graduate, I was faced with a heavy retake of the courses that I still struggle with. They all called me stupid, when there was a better way to go, when you could still study, but you chose to waste your own path. That's true, I really wasted myself, and in the eyes of everyone, including myself, I was a poor student who was almost dropped out of school for playing games. But poor students don't want to study, I hate scores and grade points that are compared with each other, I hate impromptu exams, and I hate activities linked to various assessments. I just wish I could do what I love to do, I tell myself; With so many people in the world, how many can do whatever they want? They all say so. They were right, but that's why I don't want to be limited by the tracks of my life. There are so many people in the world, not all of them are eager to make money, and company executives and cleaners, if it is out of their own love, then they should be equally happy. There is no noble distinction between professions and themselves, and people's progress cannot be defined by whether they study hard or not, there are many roads in the world, why do so many people have to squeeze into the roads that they are not interested in, or even disgusted? Most of people's aspirations lie in money, and money drives people down the same path, allowing them to evaluate each other in terms of their ability to get money or how much money they can get in the future. But the depth of life is much deeper than money, people shouldn't run around for life all their lives, if it were me, I would rather die with unattainable ideals. I can't and can't explain a lot about the value of life, because my knowledge is still shallow. I am currently studying Marxist theory and Mao Zedong's Selected Works, and I hope that one day in the future I will be able to combine my ideas with those of my predecessors in proletarianism and pass them on to the world through my own unique medium (game). I don't dare to say what I think is right, or that I should say that even if what I do turns out to be wrong, I will continue without hesitation until I get the result. As I introduced myself and said:
### No Pilgrim Has Ever Seen a God
Pilgrims will walk alone on their own pilgrimage path, and before they go far enough, they will die in obscurity and eventually die at the feet of non-existent gods. But in fact, the pilgrims died on their own path, and in order to practice their faith, they never tired of it, and it is not a pity to die. If the world thinks I'm a fool, then I'm a fool, but my will doesn't change because of other people's eyes, I am who I am, and I should walk on the path of what I believe. That's it.

### 1.2 About Me and Indie Games (2)
As a game lover, I didn't know much about PS and Switch, and my family didn't even know what it was. It was only after college that I had the opportunity to get in touch with these so-called game consoles. From a personal point of view, the quality of the game console is much better than the so-called mobile game, the so-called machine that specializes in playing games, can make people play games more immersively, and successfully separate work and entertainment, and the quality of the game is more guaranteed. Many masterpieces, such as "Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" and "Silent Hill", are released on game consoles. The reason why I distinguish between consoles and PC games is because I want to explain the artistry of games, video games are called the "ninth art", and many times, the idea of the game developer determines the artistic landscape of a game, and to put it more extremely, the game itself is the manifestation of the specific idea of the developer. A game that heals people's hearts, a game that satirizes reality, a game that rejects war, or simply a game that only wants to make money, the content of which is displayed is the idea of the developer behind it, and an indie game is a reality builder who builds his own ideas into reality. I became an indie game producer with the goal of bringing my thoughts about the world to everyone, and to show everyone how I face the world. I'm not a genius, I'm not a good student, I hate to rush to my studies, but I'm passionate about learning, and even if a lot of it doesn't help me, I am very interested in this knowledge, and I am willing to learn it. I want my passion to be able to focus on what I love instead of forcing myself to do something I don't like, which is why I became an indie game designer.

### 1.3 The idea of the birth of Journey
As an indie game producer who is just starting out in game development, I actually have a lot of ideas in my head for interesting game ideas and in-depth game content. In the original idea, I intended to construct a vast galactic setting and a pair of lovers who have lost touch with each other (I even came up with the name of the game Lost In Space), and the ending of the story will highlight the insignificance of human emotions in time and space at the size of the universe, and hopefully tell the player that life is not a big deal, love and hate, likes and dislikes, happiness and sorrow are just emotions. Perhaps the existence of no person or thing is important on the empty scale of the universe, but man is always looking for some kind of meaning, and for his own scale, he is the whole of the universe of "himself". Beasts don't feel empty, and neither do machines, so even if man constantly denies his own meaning, it's just a proof that it really exists. This was what I originally planned for the game, but for a variety of reasons, I chose to give up and start working on the idea of Journey instead, which I'll explain more later. Thought is inherited from Lost In Space, and Journey is also about the meaning of man's existence in the world. I won't reveal too much about the content of the game here, but it's roughly the magical story of a little black cat adventuring in a fantasy continent. I hope that this game can bring spiritual comfort to people who are struggling with their future, people who are numb to life, and people who are confused in the future, as a beacon to see their own thoughts and desires clearly, and to get rid of meaningless disputes and embark on their own path. I don't dare to make too many promises about the final content, but I will do my best to complete it, perfect it, and bring the best experience to everyone.

## 2. The technologies and problems encountered in the development process
### 2.1 Use of Technology
#### 2.1.1 Selection of Game Engines
At first, I planned to use Pygame to complete this project, but considering that the size of Pygame is really stretched, and the Godot engine has indeed received more attention, especially in the production of pixel games, I finally decided to use Godot engine development.
#### 2.1.2 Use of other resource tools
Art Design: Aseprite, for the creation of pixel art. Music Design: 1BITGRAGEN and FL Studio are used for the design of 8-bit music and other music.
#### 2.1.3 Programming language design
Use Godot's built-in language and C#.

## 3. Something I want to say to everyone
### 3.1 Write before you finish
Here's what I wrote when I first started this project, and I'm not sure I'll be able to complete it. If one day I finish this project, I will tell you what I think and what I have learned from some of the problems I have encountered and some of the lessons I have gained in this place. In this way, I can not only share my experience with people who want to make indie games in the future, but also have a dialogue between my past self and my current self. I know how much I have grown and to what extent I can do it, and as for the meaning of doing so, leave it to my future self to explain, I believe he can explain it. (Actually, I don't want to write too much now) Anyway, I'll move first, and go to the future ending first.
